# CMPT 145: Linear ADTs
# Implements the Queue ADT
#
# A queue (also called a FIFO queue) is a compound data
# structure in which the data values are ordered according to
# the FIFO (first-in first-out) protocol.
#
# Implementation notes:
# This implementation was designed to point out when ADT operations are
# used incorrectly.
